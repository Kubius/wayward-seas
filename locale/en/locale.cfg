[item-description]
sunnycomb-seed=A chunk of harvested sunnycomb. Can be directly replanted in most soils.
cuttlepop-seed=A slightly desiccated rattling spore pod. Can be directly planted in Gleba shallows.
cut-water-cane=A section of water cane. Can be directly planted in Gleba shallows.
lakebed-mulch=Can raise deep lakes on Gleba, allowing for passage or basic cultivation.

[fluid-name]
gleba-resin=Volatile resin

[recipe-name]
sunnycomb-processing=Sunnycomb processing

lakebed-mulch=Lakebed mulch
excavation-brace=Excavation brace
gleba-resin=Resin liquefaction

[technology-name]
lakebed-mulch=Lakebed mulch
excavation-brace=Excavation brace
fungal-productivity=Fungal productivity
resin-tech=Resin liquefaction
resin-rocketry=Direct resin combustion

[technology-description]
lakebed-mulch=Raises deep Gleban lake to shallow. Useful for expanding basic cultivation or connecting wetlands for foot travel.
excavation-brace=Clamps down Gleban "soil" to create deep water. Larger spans are more effective pentapod deterrents, with a 30-tile span impeding even the largest strafers.
fungal-productivity=Better separation of useful biomass improves yield from basic cultivars.
resin-tech=With adequate pressure and heat, local Gleba cultivars can be processed into a volatile resin.
resin-rocketry=Precise control of the intermix ratio allows rockets to directly detonate resin without further additives.

[tile-name]
raised-lakebed=Raised lakebed
excavated-trench=Excavated trench

[mod-setting-name]
gleba_start_faster_rockets=Simplify Gleba start rocket research
pentapod_evo_curve=Strafer/stomper evolution delay
always_evo_curve=Always use evolution delay
enable_excav_brace=Enable excavation brace
excav_brace_yield=Excavation brace crafting yield
enable_ws_worldgen=Wayward Seas Gleba generation
world_gen_revision=World generation revision
soil_fertility_tweaks=Soil fertility tweaks
do_ws_start_checkup=Startup complementary mod check

[mod-setting-description]
gleba_start_faster_rockets=Reduces the research cost of carbon fiber and rocket turrets when starting on Gleba (or when Planet Picker is enabled), as well as no longer requiring space science for them.
pentapod_evo_curve=Adjusts how fast stompers and strafers evolve in Gleba starts. 100% strength prevents stompers/strafers appearing until 10% evolution, defers medium to 30%, and big to 70%. Wrigglers are unaffected.
always_evo_curve=Enables strafer/stomper evolution deferral universally, instead of restricting it to Gleba starts.
enable_excav_brace=Whether the excavation brace (item to lower certain Gleba shallows to pseudo deep lake) can be researched and crafted. Disable if you want closer-to-vanilla defensive requirements.
excav_brace_yield=How many excavation braces (item to lower certain Gleba shallows to pseudo deep lake) are produced from one batch. Setting provided to balance yield to your preference.
enable_ws_worldgen=DO NOT DISABLE ON NEW SAVES. When disabled, uses vanilla Gleba world generation. Offered to allow use of the non-worldgen features in previously vanilla saves.
world_gen_revision=Which version of Wayward Seas world generation to utilize. Offered for backwards compatibility with saves - see mod page for details.
soil_fertility_tweaks=Adjusts the coverage and richness of yumako and jellynut wetlands and soils across different water coverage settings, to maintain reliable availability.
do_ws_start_checkup=In newly-created worlds, checks for the presence of certain recommended mod pairings, and informs/alerts you regarding whether or not they're present.

[wayward-seas-intro]
recommended-mods-installed=Wayward Seas: Recommended mod pairings are installed. Welcome aboard! Please leave any feedback on the mod page.
no-recommended-mods=Wayward Seas: NOTICE - Cargo Ships and AAI Vehicles: Ironclad are highly recommended as companion mods. While not required, they are part of the intended experience.
cargo-ships-missing=Wayward Seas: NOTICE - Cargo Ships is not installed. If you are not intentionally omitting the mod, it is heavily recommended to include it.
ironclad-missing=Wayward Seas: NOTICE - AAI Vehicles: Ironclad is not currently installed. It is recommended if Gleba will be your first or second planet.
