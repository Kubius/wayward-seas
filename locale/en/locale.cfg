cuttlepop-seed=Cuttlepop pod
lakebed-mulch=Lakebed mulch
excavation-brace=Excavation brace

[item-description]
sunnycomb-seed=A chunk of harvested sunnycomb. Can be directly replanted in most soils.
cuttlepop-seed=A slightly desiccated rattling spore pod. Can be directly planted in Gleba shallows.
lakebed-mulch=Can raise deep lakes on Gleba, allowing for passage or basic cultivation.

[technology-name]
lakebed-mulch=Lakebed mulch
excavation-brace=Excavation brace
fungal-productivity=Fungal productivity
resin-tech=Resin liquefaction
resin-rocketry=Direct resin combustion

[technology-description]
lakebed-mulch=Raises deep Gleban lake to shallow. Useful for expanding basic cultivation or connecting wetlands for foot travel.
excavation-brace=Clamps down Gleban "soil" to create deep water. Larger spans are more effective pentapod deterrents, with a 30-tile span impeding even the largest strafers.
fungal-productivity=Better separation of useful biomass improves yield from basic cultivars.
resin-tech=With adequate pressure and heat, local Gleba cultivars can be processed into a volatile resin.
resin-rocketry=Precise control of the intermix ratio allows rockets to directly detonate resin without further additives.

[tile-name]
raised-lakebed=Raised lakebed
excavated-trench=Excavated trench

[mod-setting-name]
enable_excav_brace=Enable excavation brace
excav_brace_yield=Excavation brace crafting yield
enable_ws_worldgen=Wayward Seas Gleba generation
world_gen_revision=World generation revision
soil_fertility_tweaks=Soil fertility tweaks

[mod-setting-description]
enable_excav_brace=Whether the excavation brace (item to lower certain Gleba shallows to pseudo deep lake) can be researched and crafted. Disable if you want closer-to-vanilla defensive requirements.
excav_brace_yield=How many excavation braces (item to lower certain Gleba shallows to pseudo deep lake) are produced from one batch. Setting provided to balance yield to your preference.
enable_ws_worldgen=DO NOT DISABLE ON NEW SAVES. When disabled, uses vanilla Gleba world generation. Offered to allow use of the non-worldgen features in previously vanilla saves.
world_gen_revision=Which version of Wayward Seas world generation to utilize. Offered for backwards compatibility with saves - see mod page for details.
soil_fertility_tweaks=Adjusts the coverage and richness of yumako and jellynut wetlands and soils across different water coverage settings, to maintain reliable availability.
