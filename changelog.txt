Version: 0.8.3

  Author:
    - Fr_Dae

  Changes:
    - Added French localization.
    - Added Russian localization.
    - info.json cleanup

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.2

  Changes:
    - Added a setting to disable the startup check for recommended mod pairings.
    - Gleba starts with Any Planet Start: Military science now has resin liquefaction as a prerequisite to improve discoverability of alternate grenade production.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.1

  Changes:
    - Added the 'organic-or-assembling' category to assembling machine 1 alongside 'organic-or-hand-crafting' (both are minor adjustments to make clean starts easier).
    - Added documentation for source publication.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0

  Changes:
    - Implemented a new world generation revision that entirely discards the ridge element of generation in favor of pure island peaks.
    - This is a breaking update, world generation revision 3; the previous version remains available in settings for backwards compatibility.
    - If you already had the mod installed, you may need to change to revision 3 manually to receive the new generation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.2

  Changes:
    - Set of changes to improve defensive pacing against pentapods, particularly in Gleba starts that don't begin on an island.
    - Researching rocket turrets and carbon fiber in Gleba starts has been reduced dramatically in cost and no longer requires space science. This can be disabled in config.
    - Strafers/stompers evolve more slowly on Gleba starts (0% > 10% for them to appear at all, 10% > 30% for any medium, 60% > 70% for any big). Config can enable this for any start, weaken it, or disable it.
    - Harvest emissions from cuttlepop and sunnycomb have been reduced by 40%, reducing the spores per net fruit production from 0.33 (slightly above vanilla crops' 0.3) to 0.2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.1

  Changes:
    - Cuttlepop and sunnycomb yield is now a fixed number, to avoid agricultural towers harvesting crops they may sometimes not have adequate space for.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0

  Changes:
    - Water cane now yields cut water cane instead of wood, and cut water cane is used for replanting it.
    - Wild water cane now yields two pieces of cut water cane instead of one wood; cultivated water cane yields three pieces at the same pace as before.
    - Cut water cane has the same fuel value as wood. To get actual wood for crafting purposes, you can process the cane into wood at a 2:1 ratio (biochamber productivity permitted).
    - Existing setups using wood solely for fuel should be largely unaffected, besides potential filter changes. Wood product manufacture will need larger adjustments.
    - Above changes fix a bug with Lignumis compatibility where wood planting into water cane would override that mod's use of wood as a flooring.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.1

  Changes:
    - Only Gleba compatibility: Cuttlepop and sunnycomb processing are unlocked by default with Only Gleba active.
    - Cuttlepop and sunnycomb processing no longer allow decomposition for tooltip costs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0

  Changes:
    - Introduced new procedures for soil fertility adjustment, making it respond better to water coverage. "Richness" refers to how much of the wetland is natural soil.
    - High water coverage now scales up the coverage/richness of fertile soils/wetlands. All water coverage levels are now playable, though 600% is not recommended as it does odd things to scaling.
    - Low water coverage no longer has patches quite as vast as before, but their richness hasn't decreased.
    - Default coverage (100%) only has minor changes to the starting area, and should be seamlessly compatible with existing 100% coverage saves.
    - If you are not on default coverage and want to preserve your exact world generation, changes in this update can be disabled with the "Soil fertility tweaks" config setting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.6

  Changes:
    - Excavation brace map color lightened a bit.
    - Excavation brace now defaults to disabled, to cement its role as an optional tool to curtail difficulty.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.5

  Changes:
    - Excavation brace can now be disabled in config for players who don't like its effect on game balance or feel.
    - If excavation braces are disabled when already in use, existing trenches won't be destroyed but will yield one iron stick when dug (avoids breaking things).
    - Adjusted one of the warnings for lack of companion mod (Ironclad) to go "full-screen" only when Any Planet Start is calibrated to Gleba, rather than merely installed.
    - Moved most prototype setup to data phase.
    - Added versions to certain dependencies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4

  Changes:
    - Adjusted excavation brace research cost to differ between Gleba start and other-planet starts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3

  Changes:
    - Excavation braces, a new item and technology, "anchor" Gleba's squishy shallows to force them deeper, allowing you to create moats and sever parts of island chains.
    - Excavation brace recipe yield can be adjusted in config to tune the balance to your liking.
    - Added the Ironclad as an optional dependency for improved discoverability.
    - New playthroughs will now check if recommended mods are present, and inform you if they are not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2

  Changes:
    - Reintroduced Cargo Ships as a dependency (optional this time) for improved discoverability.
    - Removed slipstack plantability adjustment (now done on that mod's end).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1

  Changes:
    - Change set mainly focused on improving the capabilities of volatile resin for supplying local defenses at shallows chokepoints.
    - Volatile resin now produces 250 resin per batch at baseline, up from 150.
    - Volatile resin and resin-based rockets now benefit from the fungal productivity research. Each receive a 10% productivity bonus per tier.
    - For "conservation of mass" after productivity enters play, affected recipes were adjusted a bit:
    - Volatile resin fluid inputs (water and steam) were increased notably (150/50 > 500/100).
    - Resin-based rockets now cost an additional iron plate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0

  Changes:
    - Introduced resin processing, a new production chain to make manufacture of basic explosives and general defenses more approachable (particularly for Gleba starts).
    - As you break down local flora for copper bacteria, you clue into a sunnycomb constituent capable of being processed into a more acutely combustible form (that doesn't explode in your face like boompuff).
    - One wood and one sunnycomb propagule, processed with 150 water and 50 steam, provides you with 150 volatile resin.
    - Assembling machines of tier 2 and above can produce grenades using 500 volatile resin and 5 iron plates.
    - Chemical plants and biochambers can combine 200 volatile resin with 1 sulfur and 2 carbon to produce 2 explosives.
    - Volatile resin can also be used by flamethrower turrets; its slightly sticky properties make it quite effective, but impractical to package for portable flamethrower ammo.
    - An additional researchable technology allows you to directly produce rockets from resin, enabling local agricultural production of rockets anywhere on the planet.
    - Direct resin rocket production costs 150 resin instead of 1 explosive, and takes 2x the manufacture time per rocket.
    - Any Planet Start is now an optional dependency, to cancel its addition of sulfur processing as a military science pack prerequisite due to new grenade acquisition.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2

  Changes:
    - Lakebed mulch is now unlocked by crafting the agricultural tower.
    - Lakebed mulch is now a valid planting target for slipstacks from the Slipstack Agriculture mod.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1

  Changes:
    - Updated world generation revision config to make available revisions clearer.
    - Added a config option to disable Wayward Seas world generation entirely; this is not recommended for fresh saves, but allows trying new features in a previously-vanilla save.
    - Update info file to indicate mod is for Space Age in the mod portal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0

  Changes:
    - Substantially increased the area around the starting area that is safe from pentapod spawns; it was previously decreased incidentally through other worldgen changes.
    - Altered core world generation to increase the scale of highlands, and overall rebalance terrain distribution for a more consistent experience on default settings.
    - The core world generation change is NOT compatible with existing worlds; select version 1 world generation in startup settings for backwards compatibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0

  Changes:
    - Introduced fungal productivity, allowing you to more efficiently process the basic crops for improved yield. Early levels are very quick to acquire, and useful for Gleba starts.
    - Increased water cane yield again so it's ahead in raw fuel value for real this time. Now always yields 3 wood (putting it at ~0.89 net yield a minute vs. the other crops' 0.75).
    - Corrected a description error in cuttlepop (spore pod, not seed pod) and slightly updated main description.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3

  Changes:
    - Fixed an error in stone patch depth bonus structure that was causing stone patches to generate at low density in places they shouldn't generate at all.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2

  Changes:
    - Cleaned up unnecessary cloning of autoplace settings on new crops.
    - Improved stone patch richness 2x and halved highlands stone bonus from 10x to 5x.
    - Increased contiguity of stone patches and moved them slightly deeper into water on average (some will still be close to shore).
    - Stone patches that are more deeply submerged receive a moderate bonus to richness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1

  Changes:
    - Substantially reduced spore production from the simple crops (5 > 2 for sunnycomb, 3 > 1 for cuttlepop).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0

  Changes:
    - Add lakebed mulch, an artificial "water soil" that raises Gleban deep lakebed into shallows suitable for walking or simple-crop cultivation.
    - Remove landfill prohibition on deep lake (stone cost is already enough of a downside vs. refined concrete).
    - With lakebed mulch providing a new way to extend footpaths, Cargo Ships is no longer marked as required, though it remains heavily recommended.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5

  Changes:
    - Buffed watercane cultivation to make it narrowly ahead of cuttlepop in raw fuel value (grow time 3m > 2m15s, 2-3 wood instead of 2).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4

  Changes:
    - Added missing weight parameter to the simple crops and returned their direct-burn fuel value to original (2MJ).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3

  Changes:
    - Dialed back spoilage yield from sunnycomb and cuttlepop to line up better with the sink from ore smelting (not full consumption, but much closer)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2

  Changes:
    - Enabled simple organic crafting processes (such as sunnycomb and cuttlepop seed processing) in assembling machine 1 for easier fresh starts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1

  Changes:
    - Quick buff to the simple crops (1 > 2 bacteria yield, doubled fuel value, increased spoilage yield).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0

  Changes:
    - Initial release.
