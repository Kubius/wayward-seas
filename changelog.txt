---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0

  Changes:
    - Introduced resin processing, a new production chain to make manufacture of basic explosives and general defenses more approachable (particularly for Gleba starts).
    - As you break down local flora for copper bacteria, you clue into a sunnycomb constituent capable of being processed into a more acutely combustible form (that doesn't explode in your face like boompuff).
    - One wood and one sunnycomb propagule, processed with 150 water and 50 steam, provides you with 150 volatile resin.
    - Assembling machines of tier 2 and above can produce grenades using 500 volatile resin and 5 iron plates.
    - Chemical plants and biochambers can combine 200 volatile resin with 1 sulfur and 2 carbon to produce 2 explosives.
    - Volatile resin can also be used by flamethrower turrets; its slightly sticky properties make it quite effective, but impractical to package for portable flamethrower ammo.
    - An additional researchable technology allows you to directly produce rockets from resin, enabling local agricultural production of rockets anywhere on the planet.
    - Direct resin rocket production costs 150 resin instead of 1 explosive, and takes 2x the manufacture time per rocket.
    - Any Planet Start is now an optional dependency, to cancel its addition of sulfur processing as a military science pack prerequisite due to new grenade acquisition.

Version: 0.4.2

  Changes:
    - Lakebed mulch is now unlocked by crafting the agricultural tower.
    - Lakebed mulch is now a valid planting target for slipstacks from the Slipstack Agriculture mod.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1

  Changes:
    - Updated world generation revision config to make available revisions clearer.
    - Added a config option to disable Wayward Seas world generation entirely; this is not recommended for fresh saves, but allows trying new features in a previously-vanilla save.
    - Update info file to indicate mod is for Space Age in the mod portal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0

  Changes:
    - Substantially increased the area around the starting area that is safe from pentapod spawns; it was previously decreased incidentally through other worldgen changes.
    - Altered core world generation to increase the scale of highlands, and overall rebalance terrain distribution for a more consistent experience on default settings.
    - The core world generation change is NOT compatible with existing worlds; select version 1 world generation in startup settings for backwards compatibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0

  Changes:
    - Introduced fungal productivity, allowing you to more efficiently process the basic crops for improved yield. Early levels are very quick to acquire, and useful for Gleba starts.
    - Increased water cane yield again so it's ahead in raw fuel value for real this time. Now always yields 3 wood (putting it at ~0.89 net yield a minute vs. the other crops' 0.75).
    - Corrected a description error in cuttlepop (spore pod, not seed pod) and slightly updated main description.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3

  Changes:
    - Fixed an error in stone patch depth bonus structure that was causing stone patches to generate at low density in places they shouldn't generate at all.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2

  Changes:
    - Cleaned up unnecessary cloning of autoplace settings on new crops.
    - Improved stone patch richness 2x and halved highlands stone bonus from 10x to 5x.
    - Increased contiguity of stone patches and moved them slightly deeper into water on average (some will still be close to shore).
    - Stone patches that are more deeply submerged receive a moderate bonus to richness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1

  Changes:
    - Substantially reduced spore production from the simple crops (5 > 2 for sunnycomb, 3 > 1 for cuttlepop).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0

  Changes:
    - Add lakebed mulch, an artificial "water soil" that raises Gleban deep lakebed into shallows suitable for walking or simple-crop cultivation.
    - Remove landfill prohibition on deep lake (stone cost is already enough of a downside vs. refined concrete).
    - With lakebed mulch providing a new way to extend footpaths, Cargo Ships is no longer marked as required, though it remains heavily recommended.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5

  Changes:
    - Buffed watercane cultivation to make it narrowly ahead of cuttlepop in raw fuel value (grow time 3m > 2m15s, 2-3 wood instead of 2).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4

  Changes:
    - Added missing weight parameter to the simple crops and returned their direct-burn fuel value to original (2MJ).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3

  Changes:
    - Dialed back spoilage yield from sunnycomb and cuttlepop to line up better with the sink from ore smelting (not full consumption, but much closer)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2

  Changes:
    - Enabled simple organic crafting processes (such as sunnycomb and cuttlepop seed processing) in assembling machine 1 for easier fresh starts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1

  Changes:
    - Quick buff to the simple crops (1 > 2 bacteria yield, doubled fuel value, increased spoilage yield).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0

  Changes:
    - Initial release.
